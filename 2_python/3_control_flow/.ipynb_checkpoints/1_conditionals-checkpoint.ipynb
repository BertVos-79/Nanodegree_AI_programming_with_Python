    "# Evaluating Model Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will determine the performance of a machine learning model based on its accuracy. The accuracy of the model will be used to classify its performance into different categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance Categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0.0 - 0.5: Poor performance\n",
    "- 0.51 - 0.75: Average performance\n",
    "- 0.76 - 0.90: Good performance\n",
    "- 0.91 - 1.0: Excellent performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Write an if statement that lets a data scientist know the performance category of their machine learning model based on the accuracy score, which is stored in the float variable accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign the result variable to a string holding the appropriate message based on the value of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the model's performance is classified as \"Poor performance\", the message should state \"Model performance: Poor.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the model's performance is classified as \"Average performance\", the message should state \"Model performance: Average.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the model's performance is classified as \"Good performance\", the message should state \"Model performance: Good.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the model's performance is classified as \"Excellent performance\", the message should state \"Model performance: Excellent.\""

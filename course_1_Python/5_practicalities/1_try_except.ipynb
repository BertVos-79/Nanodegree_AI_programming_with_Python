    "- Uses a try-except block to handle division by zero errors.\n",
    "- If the number of tasks is zero, raises a ZeroDivisionError with a custom error message.\n",
    "- If no error occurs, calculates how many resources each task gets and the number of leftover resources.\n",
    "- Returns the number of resources per task and the number of leftovers, or None values if an error occurs.\n",

    "### Validate Input in the Main Loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a main() function that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initializes a loop that continues as long as the user wants to optimize resource allocation.\n",
    "- Prompts the user to input the number of resources (cookies) and the number of tasks (people).\n",
    "- Uses a try-except block to handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values) and prints an appropriate error message.\n",
    "- Checks if the input values are positive. If not, prints an error message and prompts the user to enter valid positive numbers.\n",
    "- Calls the resource_allocator function with the user inputs and captures the returned values.\n",
    "- If the resource allocation is successful (i.e., the function does not return None values), prints the allocation results in a formatted message.\n",
    "- Asks the user if they want to continue optimizing, and exits the loop if the answer is 'n' (no).\n"

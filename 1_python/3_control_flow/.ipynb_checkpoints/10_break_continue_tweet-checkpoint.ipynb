    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a list of model feature descriptions, concatenate them into a single string for a tweet. The final string should not exceed 140 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Input**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "features = [\n",
    "    \"Feature 1: High accuracy\",\n",
    "    \"Feature 2: Low latency\",\n",
    "    \"Feature 3: Scalability\",\n",
    "    \"Feature 4: Robustness\",\n",
    "    \"Feature 5: Interpretability\"\n",
    "    \"Feature 6: User-friendly interface\",\n",
    "    \"Feature 7: High availability\",\n",
    "    \"Feature 8: Multi-platform support\"\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:\n",
    "1. Initialize an empty string `feature_summary`.\n",
    "2. Iterate through the `features` list and concatenate each feature to `feature_summary` with a space in between.\n",
    "3. Ensure the final `feature_summary` does not exceed 140 characters."

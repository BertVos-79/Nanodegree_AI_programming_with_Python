    "**Loss** is a measure of how well or poorly a model's predictions match the actual target values. It quantifies the difference between the predicted values and the actual values. The goal of training a machine learning model is to minimize this loss. Lower loss values indicate better model performance. Monitoring loss over time helps in understanding how well the model is learning and adjusting during the training process.\n"
